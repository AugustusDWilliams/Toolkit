# Development Stacks Overview
# Development Stack

## What is a Stack?

The set of languages, libraries, IDEs and tools used for application development.

Includes OS, Database Server, and Application Server

A Full-Stack Developer is expected to be able to work in all the layers of the stack.

“Stacks” are bundles of software that comprise your site’s back end—everything from the operating system and web servers to APIs and programming frameworks.

Each component provides a layer for their compatibility, and bundling them makes them easier to download and deploy all at once. The components of a stack can range from general—e.g., the Mac OS X operating system—to very specific, like a particular PHP framework.

We have a standard technology stack that we use for each new project by default.
This provides a proven base for rapid, quality development and ensures we have a
large team of developers ready to jump on new projects using a known technology.
It helps to avoid decision fatigue at the beginning of each project.


We will also swap in alternate technology as necessary when our default stack is
inappropriate for the task at hand. This allows us to practice our value of
[Quality].


## Examples
To develop a web application the *Architect* defines the stack as:
- The Target Operating System
- Web Server
- Database
- Programming Language

Another version of a software stack is:
- Operating System
- Middleware
- Database
- Applications

A popular stack is *LAMP*:
- Linux (OS)
- Apache (Web Server)
- MySQL or MariaDB (Database Management Systems)
- Perl, PHP, or Python (Scripting Languages)

## Layers

Our stack is broken up into layers. Each layer depends on another layer. This
allows us to swap out an entire layer when necessary without losing all the
decisions made for other layers.
